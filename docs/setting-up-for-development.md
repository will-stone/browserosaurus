# Setting up for development

Ensure you are running the correct version of Node. The repo includes an
`.nvmrc` file that includes the version number I use.

Clone the repo:

```
git clone git@github.com:will-stone/browserosaurus.git
```

Move to folder:

```
cd browserosaurus
```

Install dependencies:

```
npm i
```

Run Browserosaurus in dev mode:

```
npm start
```
