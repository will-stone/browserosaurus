# Browserosaurus

Browserosaurus is an open-source (GPLv3 license), browser prompter for macOS. It
works by setting itself as the default browser; any clicked links in non-browser
apps are now sent to Browserosaurus where you are presented with a menu of all
your installed browsers. You may now decide which app you’d like to continue
opening the link with.
