# Browserosaurus

Browserosaurus is an open-source (MIT license), browser prompter
for macOS. It works by setting itself as the default browser; any clicked links
in non-browser apps are now sent to Browserosaurus where you are presented with
a menu of all your installed browsers. You may now decide which app you’d like
to continue opening the link with.
