# Browserosaurus

Browserosaurus is an open-source (GPLv3 license), browser prompter for macOS. It
works by setting itself as the default browser; any clicked links in non-browser
apps are now sent to Browserosaurus where you are presented with a menu of all
your installed browsers. You may now decide which app you’d like to continue
opening the link with.

[GitHub releases page](https://github.com/will-stone/browserosaurus/releases/latest).

Or use [Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/browserosaurus#default). Thank
you very much to [@i0ntempest](https://github.com/i0ntempest) and

> version.**
